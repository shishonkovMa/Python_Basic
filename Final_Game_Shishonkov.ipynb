    "You control the snake and your goal is to eat as much food as possible (in our case, it's a red square)\n",

    "You can direct the snake up, down, right or left using the keys (ᐃ, ᐁ, ᐅ, ᐊ) respectively.\n",

    "It is also important to note that the game ends when the snake bumps into the edge of the board or its own tail.\n",

    "* The direction of the snake is set by the head, i.e. the rest of the snake after the head moves along the same trajectory as the head after it;\n",
    "* If a snake eats a red square, it becomes one unit longer;\n",
    "* If the snake bites itself, then the game stops and the bite spot lights up red;\n",
    "* If the snake hits the borders of the board, then the game stops and the snake's head lights up red."
